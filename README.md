# Machine Learning Final Project

This repository contains code I wrote for the final project of a machine 
learning course I took at American University in spring 2022. 
I used linear regression and random forests to predict taste-testers' 
ratings of chocolate bars, using several categorical features and a sentiment 
score extracted from a text feature.
